The project we have developed is a world game called GHOST GAME, built using python 
and tkinter library. The game is designed for two players. Here at each turn, a player is 
shown a set of letters on screen. From those, they must choose one to add to the growing 5- 
letter word, one letter at a time. The twist is the dictionary is predefined, but players are 
unaware. Therefore, if a player adds a letter that is not in that dictionary word and player who 
completes a valid word, both lose the round. 
In the game 10 different letters are shown at every turn. From these letters some are correct, 
and others are for distraction. After each round, the winner gets a point, and the updated point 
is shown on the display. Players can also start a new round at any time using a reset button 
without closing the app.
